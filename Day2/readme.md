# Day 2 Notes

# Data types:

In Python we have several data structures, which are fundamental in programming since they store information and allow us to manage it.

# Examples:

string(str) - "hello", "%$&", "", "123"
integer(int) - 150, 1, 555, -15, 0
floating(float) - 1.25, 25.0, 500.50, -95.1
lists(list) - ["sea", 1, -3, 4.5, "mars", 0]
dictionaries(dict) - {'color':'blue', 'dog':'chop'} (pairs)
tuples(tuple) ('mon', 'tue, 'wed', 'thu', 'fri')
sets(set) {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}
booleans(bool) - True, False

# Variables:

Variables are containers for storing data values of different types, and (as their name suggests), they can change over the code's execution. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it, so you don't need to declare them first.

# Examples:

name = input('Enter your name: ')
print("Your name is " + name)

num1 = 55
num2 = 45
print(num1 + num2)
=> 100
